# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on real-world datasets using **Python**. The aim is to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and summarize data characteristics through visualization and statistical techniques. Key libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** are used for data manipulation and visualization.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and correct data types.
- **Data Visualization:** Use graphs and plots to gain insights.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Identify patterns, correlations, and distributions in the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (3.x)
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** (recommended for interactive data analysis)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eda-project.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd eda-project
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook eda_project.ipynb
   ```
## Usage
1. Load your dataset in the `/data` folder.
2. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.
3. Customize the analysis as needed to fit your data and objectives.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, filtering, and type conversions.
- **Visualization Tools:** Histogram, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Summary statistics, distribution checks, and trend analysis.
- **Report Generation:** Export results and plots for documentation.

## Results
The project provides visual insights and statistical summaries that can support data-driven decision-making, helping users understand the underlying patterns in their data.
